'''
Given folders of the full images from the human protein atlas, extract single cell crops.
To obtain single cell crops, an otsu filter is used to segment the nuclei channel, and then large enough connected
components in the nuclei channel are used as the centers for these crops.

Given an image, extract single cell crops:
ARGUMENTS:
imagepath: full path of the image
foldername: name of the folder image is in
imagename: name of the jpeg file
savepath: directory to save single cell crops to (will save in a subdirectory named after the folder)
outfile: file to write coordinates of cell centers to (for debugging purposes)
scale: scale to downsize original images by
cropsize: size of square crops (in pixels on the rescaled image) to extract
